## Overview
System design is a crucial skill for software engineers, encompassing everything from architectural decisions to implementation details. This repository serves as both a learning resource and a practical guide for engineers looking to strengthen their system design capabilities.

## System Design Fundamentals

### Types of System Architectures
- **Monolithic Architecture**
  - Single codebase approach
  - Pros: Simple to develop, test, and deploy
  - Cons: Scaling challenges, tight coupling
  
- **Microservices Architecture**
  - Distributed system approach
  - Service independence
  - Better scalability and maintenance
  - Challenges: Service coordination, data consistency

- **Event-Driven Architecture**
  - Asynchronous communication
  - Loose coupling
  - Real-time processing capabilities

### Key Considerations
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Availability
- Performance
- Security
- Cost-effectiveness
